Houdiniseed
===========

Houdini to Appleseed

* How To Use
Copy soho/appleseed.py to $(HFS)/houdini/python2.6
Install otls/appleseed.otl

You could construct the assemblies for appleseed now, remember to group blocks.

Now there is an issue to call applessed.cli from Houdini, so that you should export the scene.

* Limitation
No motion blur
Only polygon mesh
